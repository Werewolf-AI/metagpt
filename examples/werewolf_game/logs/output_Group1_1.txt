I suggest we discuss further before making any votes, but I'm leaning towards supporting Player2's claim while remaining cautious about the overall situation."

                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".
Player6(Witch): 12 | PASS
Moderator(Moderator): 13 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6'].
Player2(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Alright, everyone, let's think critically here. No one was eliminated last night, which is kinda sus, right? I mean, it feels like someone’s holding back. We should definitely keep an eye on the quieter players, especially Player3 and Player6. They haven't really contributed much yet. I reckon we should discuss who seems the least engaged, because that might just be a strategy to blend in. Let's not jump to conclusions, but we need to be smart about our next moves. What do you all think?
Player2(Seer): 21 | Alright everyone, listen up! I gotta come clean—I'm the Seer, and I verified Player1 last night. Guess what? They're a werewolf! So, we need to band together and vote to eliminate Player1. Don't let them fool you with their talk about quieter players; that's just a distraction. Let's take out the real threat before they strike again!
Player3(Guard): 21 | Given the current tension and the conflicting claims, I think it's crucial to protect someone who might be targeted. I won't reveal my identity just yet, but I will keep a close eye on Player2's actions moving forward. For now, I suggest we discuss further before making any votes.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Let's not rush into any decisions here. Player2's claim to be the Seer raises some questions. We need to consider the possibility that they might be trying to mislead us. Player1's accusations seem like a way to divert our attention from the real threats. I suggest we take a moment to analyze the situation further before making any votes. We should keep our options open and not jump to conclusions.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I'm feeling the tension in the air, and it's clear we need to tread carefully. Player2's bold claim about Player1 being a werewolf is intriguing but could also be a tactic to mislead us. I think we should keep our focus on Player1, as their behavior seems manipulative. However, let's not forget that Player2 could also be playing us. I suggest we discuss more before making any votes, but I'm leaning towards voting to eliminate Player1 based on the current evidence. What do you all think?
Player6(Witch): 21 | Let's take a moment to dissect the claims being made. Player2's assertion about Player1 being a werewolf is significant, but we must also consider the possibility of deception. Player1's defensive stance raises eyebrows, yet we shouldn't overlook the potential for Player2 to be manipulating the narrative. It's essential we remain vigilant and analyze the dynamics at play. I suggest we discuss further before making any votes, but I'm leaning towards supporting Player2's claim while remaining cautious about the overall situation.

Player2(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Alright, everyone, let's think critically here. No one was eliminated last night, which is kinda sus, right? I mean, it feels like someone’s holding back. We should definitely keep an eye on the quieter players, especially Player3 and Player6. They haven't really contributed much yet. I reckon we should discuss who seems the least engaged, because that might just be a strategy to blend in. Let's not jump to conclusions, but we need to be smart about our next moves. What do you all think?
Player2(Seer): 21 | Alright everyone, listen up! I gotta come clean—I'm the Seer, and I verified Player1 last night. Guess what? They're a werewolf! So, we need to band together and vote to eliminate Player1. Don't let them fool you with their talk about quieter players; that's just a distraction. Let's take out the real threat before they strike again!
Player3(Guard): 21 | Given the current tension and the conflicting claims, I think it's crucial to protect someone who might be targeted. I won't reveal my identity just yet, but I will keep a close eye on Player2's actions moving forward. For now, I suggest we discuss further before making any votes.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Let's not rush into any decisions here. Player2's claim to be the Seer raises some questions. We need to consider the possibility that they might be trying to mislead us. Player1's accusations seem like a way to divert our attention from the real threats. I suggest we take a moment to analyze the situation further before making any votes. We should keep our options open and not jump to conclusions.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I'm feeling the tension in the air, and it's clear we need to tread carefully. Player2's bold claim about Player1 being a werewolf is intriguing but could also be a tactic to mislead us. I think we should keep our focus on Player1, as their behavior seems manipulative. However, let's not forget that Player2 could also be playing us. I suggest we discuss more before making any votes, but I'm leaning towards voting to eliminate Player1 based on the current evidence. What do you all think?
Player6(Witch): 21 | Let's take a moment to dissect the claims being made. Player2's assertion about Player1 being a werewolf is significant, but we must also consider the possibility of deception. Player1's defensive stance raises eyebrows, yet we shouldn't overlook the potential for Player2 to be manipulating the narrative. It's essential we remain vigilant and analyze the dynamics at play. I suggest we discuss further before making any votes, but I'm leaning towards supporting Player2's claim while remaining cautious about the overall situation.

Player2(Seer): 47 | Alright, team! We’ve lost Player3, which is a bummer, but we gotta keep our heads in the game. I’m still the Seer, and I’ve got my eyes on the remaining players. Player4 seems to be playing it safe, while Player5 is leaning towards the previous vote. Player6 hasn’t made any strong moves yet, so we need to keep an eye on them too. I suggest we discuss who seems the most suspicious right now. Let’s not forget, the werewolves might be trying to blend in, so we should be cautious about who we trust. What do you all think?
Player4(Werewolf): 47 | Let’s take a moment to analyze the situation. Player2's claim as the Seer raises some eyebrows, especially since they are targeting me. We should consider the possibility that they might be trying to mislead us. Player5 and Player6 seem to be playing it safe, but we need to be cautious about who we trust. I suggest we discuss further before making any votes, as rushing into a decision could lead us to eliminate a valuable player. What do you all think?

Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Alright, everyone, let's think critically here. No one was eliminated last night, which is kinda sus, right? I mean, it feels like someone’s holding back. We should definitely keep an eye on the quieter players, especially Player3 and Player6. They haven't really contributed much yet. I reckon we should discuss who seems the least engaged, because that might just be a strategy to blend in. Let's not jump to conclusions, but we need to be smart about our next moves. What do you all think?
Player2(Seer): 21 | Alright everyone, listen up! I gotta come clean—I'm the Seer, and I verified Player1 last night. Guess what? They're a werewolf! So, we need to band together and vote to eliminate Player1. Don't let them fool you with their talk about quieter players; that's just a distraction. Let's take out the real threat before they strike again!
Player3(Guard): 21 | Given the current tension and the conflicting claims, I think it's crucial to protect someone who might be targeted. I won't reveal my identity just yet, but I will keep a close eye on Player2's actions moving forward. For now, I suggest we discuss further before making any votes.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Let's not rush into any decisions here. Player2's claim to be the Seer raises some questions. We need to consider the possibility that they might be trying to mislead us. Player1's accusations seem like a way to divert our attention from the real threats. I suggest we take a moment to analyze the situation further before making any votes. We should keep our options open and not jump to conclusions.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I'm feeling the tension in the air, and it's clear we need to tread carefully. Player2's bold claim about Player1 being a werewolf is intriguing but could also be a tactic to mislead us. I think we should keep our focus on Player1, as their behavior seems manipulative. However, let's not forget that Player2 could also be playing us. I suggest we discuss more before making any votes, but I'm leaning towards voting to eliminate Player1 based on the current evidence. What do you all think?
Player6(Witch): 21 | Let's take a moment to dissect the claims being made. Player2's assertion about Player1 being a werewolf is significant, but we must also consider the possibility of deception. Player1's defensive stance raises eyebrows, yet we shouldn't overlook the potential for Player2 to be manipulating the narrative. It's essential we remain vigilant and analyze the dynamics at play. I suggest we discuss further before making any votes, but I'm leaning towards supporting Player2's claim while remaining cautious about the overall situation.

Player2(Seer): 47 | Alright, team! We’ve lost Player3, which is a bummer, but we gotta keep our heads in the game. I’m still the Seer, and I’ve got my eyes on the remaining players. Player4 seems to be playing it safe, while Player5 is leaning towards the previous vote. Player6 hasn’t made any strong moves yet, so we need to keep an eye on them too. I suggest we discuss who seems the most suspicious right now. Let’s not forget, the werewolves might be trying to blend in, so we should be cautious about who we trust. What do you all think?
Player4(Werewolf): 47 | Let’s take a moment to analyze the situation. Player2's claim as the Seer raises some eyebrows, especially since they are targeting me.
